# Local multiplayer arena
The game supports 2 to 4 players, so you have to find some friends to defeat. Each player then starts by choosing an alien pilot of their liking, to enter the *Superstarfighter* league.

The goal is to take the crown at the center of the arena and to keep it for as long as possible. Sounds simple, right? Wrong.

Nothing makes other pilots more angry than you zipping away with the crown. That's why each *Superstarfighter* starship has a built-in relief valve for pilots: bombs.

You can find your inner peace by smashing the *fire* button and trying to drop bombs in front of your opponent...

...or you can try a more focused, zen-like approach and keep the button pressed until you can blast them with a precise shot. Just mind the recoil!

# You can never stop
As a skilled starship pilot, you will have to steer and drop bombs while constantly moving at full speed. Brakes are for losers!

The only way to reduce your speed is to charge a shot. But this will make you stop for a very short amount of time, before being launched at a crazy speed in the direction you are facing.

# Physics-based mayhem
*Superstarfighter* arenas are chock full of moving objects, bombs, and explosions. Chasing the crown as it's slinged across a bomb-filled level is no easy feat!

# No downtime
A true starship pilot can never rest! As soon as your ship is destroyed, your team provides you with a brand new one to reenter the fray. You will never have to wait for your turn again!

# Lots of unlockable content
In the full version of the game you will be able to unlock new races, pilots and arenas.
